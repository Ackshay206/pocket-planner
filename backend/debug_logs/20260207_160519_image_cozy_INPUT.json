The bed is positioned as the focal point upon entry, and the sofa is placed at its foot to form an intimate, multi-functional relaxation zone. The work area is intentionally tucked into a corner to keep the main space dedicated to comfort and rest.\n\nFURNITURE PLACEMENT \u2014 FOLLOW EXACTLY:\n  \u2022 BED_1: Centered on the south wall, with the headboard positioned between the two low windows, serving as the focal point when entering the room.\n  \u2022 NIGHTSTAND_1: Positioned to the left of the head of bed_1, against the south wall.\n  \u2022 NIGHTSTAND_2: Positioned to the right of the head of bed_1, against the south wall.\n  \u2022 SOFA_1: Positioned at the foot of bed_1, facing the bed to form a unified lounging area. Ensure a 2-3 foot walkway between the sofa and the bed for comfortable passage.\n  \u2022 TABLE_1: Tucked into the southwest corner of the room, keeping the main walkway from the entrance clear and out of the primary sightline.\n  \u2022 CHAIR_1: Placed at table_1. Keep tucked under when not in use to maximize floor space.\n  \u2022 CHAIR_2: Placed at table_1. Keep tucked under when not in use to maximize floor space.\n  \u2022 ARTWORK_1: Mounted on the west wall, centered above table_1 to create a distinct work/dining vignette.\n  \u2022 ARTWORK_2: Center a large piece of art on the now-open east wall to visually balance the room.\n  \u2022 PLANT_1: Placed in the northeast corner, adding life and filling the space between the main living area and the bathroom entrance.\n  \u2022 RUG_1: Place a large area rug centered under the bed and sofa combination, extending at least 24 inches beyond the sides and foot to anchor the entire relaxation zone.\n  \u2022 RUG_2: Place a smaller rug under table_1 and its chairs to visually define the work/dining zone.\n  \u2022 LAMP_1: Placed on top of nightstand_1.\n  \u2022 LAMP_2: Placed on top of nightstand_2.\n\nZONES:\n  \u2022 work_zone: Contained in the southwest corner of the room, keeping it functionally separate from the primary relaxation area.\n  \u2022 sleep_zone: Located along the south wall, making it the central focal point of the room as intended.\n  \u2022 living_zone: Integrated directly with the sleep zone in the center of the room, forming a cohesive block for relaxation. Decorative elements are placed along the perimeter walls to complement this central feature.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f COZY RETREAT \u2014 KEY RULES FOR IMAGE GENERATION:\n- CRITICAL: The Bed must be centered on the wall OPPOSITE the door \u2014 it's the first thing you see entering.\n- Center the Bed with one nightstand on each side (left AND right).\n- CRITICAL: The Sofa MUST be at the FOOT of the bed (the end away from the headboard), facing the bed.

All furniture is arranged in the southern and western portions of the room, ensuring an unobstructed path from the entrance.\n\nSTRUCTURAL (fixed): Door=north (top) at ~46%, Window=interior at ~50%, Others=[refrigerator, kitchen cabinet, kitchen sink, stovetop, door, sink, sink, toilet, shower, shelf, window, window, window]\n\nOUTPUT: Same 2D style as input, all 14 items in their NEW positions, professional floor plan.\nDo NOT place furniture on top of kitchen appliances, bathroom fixtures, or any structural element.\nEdit the floor plan to show \"Cozy Retreat\"."
