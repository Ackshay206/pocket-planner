    "Relocated 'bed_1' from the proposed north-east corner to the south-east corner. The original proposal violated the CRITICAL rule to place the bed in a corner furthest from the door. The new position correctly de-emphasizes the bed and keeps it out of the initial line of sight from the entrance.",
    "Relocated 'nightstand_1' and 'nightstand_2' to flank 'bed_1' in its new, correct position.",
    "Relocated 'artwork_2' to be above the headboard of 'bed_1'. The original instruction was impossible with the bed's new corner placement.",
    "Relocated 'plant_1' from the south-east corner to the north-east corner. Its original proposed location conflicted with the new, correct placement of the bed.",
    "Consolidated 'rug_1' and 'rug_2' into a single 'rug_1'. Using two small rugs under a desk is impractical for chair movement. A single area rug better defines the 'HERO' workspace, as required by the 'Productivity Focus' style. 'rug_2' has been removed.",
    "Clarified the instruction for 'table_1' to specify its function as a desk, reinforcing the 'Productivity Focus' style goal."
