The table is positioned directly opposite the entrance against the windowed wall, creating a commanding and inspiring workspace. The bed is intentionally relocated to the furthest, most secluded corner to minimize its presence and promote a work-first mindset, while the sofa is placed to the side to maintain a clear, direct path to the desk.\n\nFURNITURE PLACEMENT \u2014 FOLLOW EXACTLY:\n  \u2022 TABLE_1: Centered on the south wall, pushed flush against it between the two windows. This serves as the primary desk and workspace.\n  \u2022 CHAIR_1: Placed at the desk (table_1) on the west side, with its back to the center of the room.\n  \u2022 CHAIR_2: Placed at the desk (table_1) on the east side, with its back to the center of the room.\n  \u2022 BED_1: In the south-east corner of the room, with the headboard against the east wall. This position is furthest from the entry door and not in the direct line of sight.\n  \u2022 NIGHTSTAND_1: Positioned to the south of bed_1, between the head of the bed and the south wall.\n  \u2022 NIGHTSTAND_2: Positioned to the north of bed_1, on the other side of the bed.\n  \u2022 SOFA_1: Pushed flush against the west wall, positioned south of the kitchenette to keep the main walkway clear.\n  \u2022 ARTWORK_1: Mounted on the west wall, centered above sofa_1.\n  \u2022 ARTWORK_2: Mounted on the east wall, centered above the headboard of bed_1.\n  \u2022 PLANT_1: Placed in the north-east corner of the room, near the bathroom door, to fill the space and add visual interest without obstructing traffic.\n  \u2022 LAMP_1: Placed on nightstand_2.\n  \u2022 RUG_1: A single area rug centered on the south wall, positioned under the desk (table_1) and chairs to define the workspace.\n  \u2022 RUG_2: None\n\nZONES:\n  \u2022 work_zone: The work zone is the primary focus, located at the south end of the room against the windowed wall. It is the first area visible upon entering the room.\n  \u2022 sleep_zone: The sleep zone is discreetly tucked into the north-east corner, the furthest point from both the door and the work zone, to separate rest from work.\n  \u2022 living_zone: The living zone is situated along the west wall, creating a distinct area for relaxation that does not impede the main circulation path to the work zone.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f PRODUCTIVITY FOCUS \u2014 KEY RULES FOR IMAGE GENERATION:\n- CRITICAL: The Table/Desk MUST be pushed flush against the wall that has the window. If no window, place it on the wall OPPOSITE the door so it's the first thing visible on entry.

No furniture is placed in the door's swing path.\n\nSTRUCTURAL (fixed): Door=north (top) at ~46%, Window=interior at ~50%, Others=[refrigerator, cabinet, kitchen counter, sink, stovetop, door, sink, sink, toilet, shower, shelf, window, window, window]\n\nOUTPUT: Same 2D style as input, all 13 items in their NEW positions, professional floor plan.\nDo NOT place furniture on top of kitchen appliances, bathroom fixtures, or any structural element.\nEdit the floor plan to show \"Productivity Focus\"."
