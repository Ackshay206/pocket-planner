    "Consolidated 'rug_1' and 'rug_2' into a single 'area_rug_1'.",
    "Reasoning: A single large area rug is superior for the 'Cozy Retreat' style. It unifies the bed and sofa into a single visual block, anchoring the main relaxation zone and making the space feel more cohesive and comfortable than two separate small rugs.",
    "Refined the descriptions for chairs and artwork to be more specific to their function within the new layout."
