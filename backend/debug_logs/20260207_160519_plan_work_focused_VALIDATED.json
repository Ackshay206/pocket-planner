    "description": "This layout establishes a clear work-first environment by positioning the table as the hero piece, immediately visible upon entry against the far windowed wall. The bed is relocated to a side wall, de-emphasizing it and keeping it out of the primary sightline from the door. This creates a direct, motivating path to the workspace, with distinct zones for sleep and relaxation on the periphery.",

      "chair_2": "Placed at table_1 on the east side, with its back to the center of the room.",
      "bed_1": "Positioned in the southeast corner, with the headboard flush against the east wall. This places the bed in the corner furthest from the entry door and the desk.",

      "nightstand_2": "Placed between bed_1 and the south wall.",

      "work_zone": "The work zone is the primary focus, occupying the full width of the south wall, making it the destination point from the entrance.",
      "sleep_zone": "The sleep zone is located along the west wall, tucked away from the main entryway and separate from the work zone.",
      "living_zone": "The living zone is situated along the east wall, creating a separate space for relaxation that does not impede the flow to the work area."
