    "description": "This layout establishes a clear hierarchy by making the work area the focal point. The table is positioned directly opposite the entrance against the windowed wall, creating a commanding and inspiring workspace. The bed is intentionally relocated to the furthest, most secluded corner to minimize its presence and promote a work-first mindset, while the sofa is placed to the side to maintain a clear, direct path to the desk.",
