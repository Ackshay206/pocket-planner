    "The proposed plan is an excellent fit for the 'Space Optimized' style and matches the image layout. All furniture is correctly placed against the perimeter, leaving the central walkway clear.",
    "Refined the description for 'nightstand_1' and 'nightstand_2' to be more precise ('at the head/foot of bed_1' instead of 'top/bottom side').",
    "Refined the description for 'artwork_2' for better accuracy. The original stated it was 'above nightstand_2', but the image shows it mounted on the wall beside the nightstand, which is a more optimal placement."
