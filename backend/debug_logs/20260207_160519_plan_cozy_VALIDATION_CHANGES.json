    "The original proposed plan was valid and correctly followed all style constraints.",
    "Refined 'bed_1' placement to specifically mention positioning it between the low windows visible on the south wall for better visual integration.",
    "Updated 'sofa_1' instruction to include a specific walkway clearance (2-3 feet) for practical traffic flow.",
    "Modified 'artwork_2' placement to suggest centering it on the now-open east wall for better room balance, rather than a vague placement.",
    "Enhanced the 'rug_1' description to specify its size relative to the furniture it anchors, which is a key design principle for defining a space.",
    "Added a practical note for 'chair_1' and 'chair_2' to be pushed in to save space in the compact room.",
    "Overall, instructions were made more specific to reflect professional interior design standards for spacing, balance, and zone definition."
