The bed is relocated to a side wall, de-emphasizing it and keeping it out of the primary sightline from the door. This creates a direct, motivating path to the workspace, with distinct zones for sleep and relaxation on the periphery.\n\nFURNITURE PLACEMENT \u2014 FOLLOW EXACTLY:\n  \u2022 TABLE_1: Centered on and flush against the south wall, positioned between the two windows.\n  \u2022 CHAIR_1: Placed at table_1 on the west side, with its back to the center of the room.\n  \u2022 CHAIR_2: Placed at table_1 on the east side, with its back to the center of the room.\n  \u2022 BED_1: Positioned in the southeast corner, with the headboard flush against the east wall. This places the bed in the corner furthest from the entry door and the desk.\n  \u2022 NIGHTSTAND_1: Placed against the east wall, on the north side of bed_1.\n  \u2022 NIGHTSTAND_2: Placed between bed_1 and the south wall.\n  \u2022 SOFA_1: Positioned flush against the west wall, in the area south of the kitchen fixtures. This keeps the central pathway to the desk clear.\n  \u2022 ARTWORK_1: Mounted on the west wall, centered above sofa_1.\n  \u2022 ARTWORK_2: Mounted on the east wall, centered above bed_1.\n  \u2022 PLANT_1: Placed in the southwest corner of the room, to the left of table_1.\n  \u2022 RUG_1: Placed on the floor in front of the west-side window on the south wall, partially under table_1.\n  \u2022 RUG_2: Placed on the floor in front of the east-side window on the south wall, partially under table_1.\n  \u2022 LAMP_1: Placed on top of nightstand_1.\n  \u2022 LAMP_2: Placed on top of nightstand_2.\n\nZONES:\n  \u2022 work_zone: The work zone is the primary focus, occupying the full width of the south wall, making it the destination point from the entrance.\n  \u2022 sleep_zone: The sleep zone is located along the west wall, tucked away from the main entryway and separate from the work zone.\n  \u2022 living_zone: The living zone is situated along the east wall, creating a separate space for relaxation that does not impede the flow to the work area.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f PRODUCTIVITY FOCUS \u2014 KEY RULES FOR IMAGE GENERATION:\n- CRITICAL: The Table/Desk MUST be pushed flush against the wall that has the window.
